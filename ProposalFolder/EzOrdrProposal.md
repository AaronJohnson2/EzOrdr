# Ordering Made Easy
## Team name: EzOrdr
### Group Members: Samuel Steinberg, Ethan Grissom, Aaron Johnson, Viktor Zenkov


##Introduction

EzOrdr will be designed for uses at restaurants, by providing a direct line of communication between the chefs of the establishment and the patrons. This will be accomplished with two distinct interfaces, the interface the kitchen (chefs) sees and the interface the customer submits their order with, which will be connected through a database or another method of communication to be determined. To further clarify, the kitchen will see the orders in form of a queue. Each element in the queue will first be marked as incomplete, and it is the kitchens role to mark orders as complete as they are completed, thereby popping the order from the queue. The time since the order was submitted will also be displayed. On the other side, the customer will make their order on a device such as a tablet the establishment will provide to the table and select which items they wish to order. This virtual menu will be styled for aesthetic purposes as well. The customers’ order will be sent to the kitchen via a database, or another method of communication to be determined. The motivation for this project is the desire to design a simple but powerful product beneficial to both the restaurant and the customer. This is accomplished by making ordering easier for patrons by taking out the filter (waiter) between their food order and the creator of their food, the chef, so that the order of the patron is exactly what they receive. This will also and cut costs for restaurants significantly, as they will not need nearly as many employees that are not involved in actually making the food and they will not waste nearly as much food in the form of receiving the wrong order (mistakes by the waiter/waitress).
In terms of the current market, our product meets a legitimate need. Currently, there are three main types of restaurants: traditional sit-down, buffet, and ordering in a line (such as Chipotle, Cava, Moes, etc.). Our product fits between ordering in a line and traditional sit-down for those who would like the traditional formal meal, but with the ease and simplicity of ordering in a line. With the widespread availability of tablets, many for under $100, our idea of connecting the patron and kitchen would be of little expense and in the end save restaurants significant amounts of money by making waiters obsolete and requiring only bussers for the customer experience. Additionally, this also fits in line with today’s political climate. Specifically, calls for a $15 federal minimum wage have been growing with more widespread support, causing significant concerns about costs, cutting staff, and reducing many employees to part-time in the restaurant/hospitality industry. EzOrdr would cut costs to the point where this shift in wages would not significantly affect workflow and allow employees to remain full-time since overall staff would be fewer than the typical restaurant. The members of our team have both front end and back-end experience, and experience working with databases. Also, each member of our team will make extensive use of data structures such as structs, classes and queues, which we have all made extensive use of in the past.
Each of our members also have experience in styling and scripting to make elements interactive. In summary, each member is equipped to contribute to both the customer, kitchen, and database portions of the project. To put our project into context, we are designing this product to cut the costs of restaurants and to make ordering as simple as it should be for a customer. Additionally, we believe this satisfies the need of a fusion between a traditional restaurant and the simplicity of ordering in a less-traditional environment along with being prepared for changes that could be brought on in the realm of politics.
